# Network Infrastructure & Linux Implementation

This repository contains comprehensive documentation for a technology consulting firm's network infrastructure design and implementation, including networking fundamentals, IP addressing schemes, and Linux server configuration.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the following technical competencies:
- Network design and implementation
- IP addressing and VLAN configuration
- Linux server deployment with DHCP services
- Security implementation and best practices

## Repository Structure

### Section 1: Network Infrastructure
- **[Device Justification](Main%20/Section1-Network/device_justification.md)**: Analysis and selection of network hardware components
- **[Packet Tracer Implementation](Main%20/Section1-Network/packet_tracer_implementation.md)**: Detailed network topology simulation

### Section 2: IP Addressing
- **[IP Addressing Scheme](Main%20/Section2-IP/ip_addressing_scheme.md)**: Comprehensive IP allocation plan
- **[VLAN & DHCP Configuration](Main%20/Section2-IP/vlan_dhcp_configuration.md)**: Network segmentation and DHCP implementation
- **[IPv6 Implementation](Main%20/Section2-IP/ipv6_implementation.md)**: Next-generation IP addressing deployment

### Section 3: Linux Server
- **[Linux Server Guide](Main%20/Section3-Linux/part3guide.md)**: Ubuntu Server installation with DHCP service, user management, and security hardening

## Implementation Highlights

### Network Infrastructure
- Multi-location network design with proper segmentation
- Robust connectivity between office locations
- Appropriate selection of network devices

### IP Management
- Structured IP addressing scheme across multiple VLANs
- DHCP implementation for automated address assignment
- Dual-stack IPv4/IPv6 deployment for future-proofing

### Linux Server
- Ubuntu Server installation and configuration
- ISC DHCP server deployment
- User access control implementation
- Comprehensive security measures:
  - Firewall configuration (UFW)
  - SSH hardening
  - Intrusion detection (Fail2ban)
  - System hardening and updates

## Technologies Used
- Cisco Packet Tracer
- Ubuntu Server 25.04
- DHCP services
- IPv4 and IPv6 protocols
- Security tools (UFW, Fail2ban)
- VMware virtualization

## Educational Purpose
This repository documents an educational assignment demonstrating proficiency in network infrastructure design, IP addressing, and Linux server implementation. The configurations focus on industry best practices and security considerations.

## Additional Resources
- The repository includes the Packet Tracer file (`MainAssignment.pkt`) demonstrating the network topology
